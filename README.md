# CM-Omar

### Goal
Create a basic optical music recognition (OMR) software that could read and play back a sheet of music to the user. The user should be able to select what
instrument the playback uses, how fast the playback plays, as well as a variety of different options. By the end of the independent study, I should have had at least
two meetings with district staff (preferably staff that have no advanced knowledge on computer science) to present my work/progress. The goal of the meetings is to
be able to accurately and easily explain the process of my algorithm and have them intuitvely understand it. 

### When
Goal: September 2020 - January 2021 

Actual: Septemeber - November 2020

### Where
Computational Mathematics independent study


### Did you succeed in your goal?
Not entirely. I made decent headway in that Omar can successfully recognize basic sheet music, such as Mary Had a Little Lamb. Omar also allows users to select what 
instrument to use during playback, and there is at least somewhat of a UI. I expect that I could have gotten much more done on Omar, however I pivoted projects about 
two and a half months in to a far larger, more ambitious project, DHS PROUD. That was the correct decision.
